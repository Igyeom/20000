Files for the 20000-Byte Challenge. (Source: https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/20000)


I'm currently attempting the "20000-Byte Challenge" originating from a Korean programming judge called BOJ. Your code must simply output the contents of the ten files given here (I've copied them over to a GitHub repo): https://github.com/Igyeom/20000 when given the index of the challenge as an integer from stdin.



e.g.
<ins>stdin</ins>
`0`

<ins>stdout</ins>
`BOJ 20000` (as seen on the repository)

So when given `0`, output the contents of file `challenge0.out`, when given `1`, output the contents of file `challenge1.out`, and vice versa.




Seems easy so far, but one rule that makes this **insanely hard**: Your code's size must not exceed **20,000 bytes**. (it's in the name of the challenge!)

To give you an idea of the scale you're working with, the total file size of all 10 files is **11.5 million bytes**. Good luck if you want to try this lol
